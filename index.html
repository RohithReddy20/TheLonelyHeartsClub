            Though our need to connect is innate, many of us frequently feel
            alone. Loneliness is the state of distress or discomfort that
            results when one perceives a gap between one’s desires for social
            connection and actual experiences of it. Even some people who are
            surrounded by others throughout the day or are in a long-lasting
            marriage still experience a deep and pervasive loneliness. Research
            suggests that loneliness poses serious threats to well-being as well
            as long-term physical health.<br /><br />
            Loneliness is as tied to the quality of one's relationships as it is
            to the number of connections one has. And it doesn’t only stem from
            heartache or isolation. A lack of authenticity in relationships can
            result in feelings of loneliness. For some, not having a coveted
            animal companion, or the absence of a quiet presence in the home
            (even if one has plenty of social contacts in the wider world), can
            trigger loneliness.

        <h2>Depression</h2>

          <p>
            Depression refers to a medical disorder that leads to feelings of
            loss of interest, as well as feelings of sadness. Depression has an
            impact on how a person behaves, thinks, and feels. There are many
            physical and emotional problems, which may emanate from depression.
            Most people suffering from depression may have negative feelings
            towards themselves. Depression has an impact on the day-to-day
            activities of an individual, especially during the days when one
            suffers from depression. Depression is a common illness, and it can
            have serious implications on a person’s life.<br /><br />The causes
            of depression include a combination of environmental, biological,
            psychological, as well as genetic factors. When a person is
            undergoing depression, neurotransmitters tend to be out of balance.
            Depression is caused by an imbalance in the various parts of the
            brain, which control sleep, thinking, behavior, mood, as well as
            appetite. Depression can also be a genetic disorder that runs in
            families

          <h2 id='about-us'>What we are about</h2>
          <p>Some people maybe born with SAIL(SHY ANXIETY INTROVERT LONELY) behaviors and others develop it after some life experience. Some may be older and experiencing added issues such as health, relationships, lifestyles and etc. This group's for those struggling with SAIL and wants change. It originally started as Social Anxiety Buster but many also has issues being Shy, Introvert or Loneliness so we changed the group title to SAIL. We're a friendly group of open minded individuals to share, learn and show support. Take the first step to join and then come meet others who're also motivated to bust their SAIL issues and feel free. You may interact in whatever your capability is or just be present in silent spirit. We'll usually meet over eats or drinks but also have other fun activities like movies, beach, hikes, park, club, concert, museum, classes, book reading, travel & etc... You could also help organize meets in your locality so we'd have calendar full of events for everyone everywhere. Your suggestions will be helpful too.
